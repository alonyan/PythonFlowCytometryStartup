1. Go to https://www.continuum.io/downloads and download the Python 2.7 version, graphical installer.
2. Open installer and follow instructions.

We will now create an environment for flow analysis. We will use the FlowCytometryTools package (http://eyurtsev.github.io/FlowCytometryTools/index.html)

3. Open terminal, and run the following command:

	conda create --name FCSenv python=2.7 spyder scipy matplotlib pandas decorator wxpython 

This will create a new environment called FCSenv with all the dependencies we need for flow analysis.

4. Once the environment is created, we will work within it. it is useful to compartmentalize working environments based on need. Activate the FCSenv by typing:
 
	source activate FCSenv

In the terminal. You’ll see (FCSenv) next to your command line name

5. Next, using pip, install flowcytometrytools in this environment by typing:

	pip install flowcytometrytools

6. Another useful tool is PyTables, which allows for relatively simple saving of processed data:

	pip install tables	

6. Copy the file fwpython from this folder and paste it in /Users/%%your_usr%%/anaconda/envs/FCSenv/bin

This will allow us to run a framework version of python and access the screen. You will need to change the permissions for this file in the terminal:
	sudo chmod 777 /Users/%%your_usr%%/anaconda/envs/FCSenv/bin/fwpython

And make sure it’s in the right format:

	dos2unix /Users/%%your_usr%%/anaconda/envs/FCSenv/bin/fwpython

7. Next, make sure you are inside FCSenv ((FCSenv) next to your command line name). If not, run 
	source activate FCSenv

Then open spyder by typing in: spyder

8. We need to tell spyder to use the framework version of python, we do this by going (in spyder) to

python>>preferences>>Run>>Use the following Python interpreter:

/Users/%%your_usr%%/anaconda/envs/FCSenv/bin/fwpython

and push OK

9. Close spyder, and reopen it by typing in spyder in the terminal. You should now have a working Python console within spyder.


10. Copy the files from the python folder in this startup package to your python folder

11. Start playing around with CBAAnalyze.py  or with ProcessComps_vs
